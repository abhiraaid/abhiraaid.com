You can reuse the code snippets or the entire website. The code is well commented. The css code is in the order I built it, so it may be a little messy, but it'll help you understand the flow of the styling.

This is not a portfolio website!

Here are some of it's features

The focus was more on User Experience and Interaction and Uniformity. The icon hover animates once, and with a delay, the text displays (using a fade in transition, it's also modified using js, it displays transition on launch, but no transition on mouseout[better when users want to move on to next])

SVG animation keyframes are used to animate the light up effect of logo

It's fully made with flex boxes and it's very neat align and justify properties. (on the source code, there's an option to actually view flex boxes' colors, by in commenting all background-color tags at once[VsCode: select background-color -> Ctrl+Shift+L to select all of that instance -> Ctrl+L to select those lines -> Ctrl+/ to turn them into comments or vice versa])
